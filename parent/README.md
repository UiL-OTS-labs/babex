#Babex-parent

This application is designed for the parents of babies that are invited to the
lab. The parents should be able to use the website without logging in.

The application communicates with the [babex-lab] application, that application
holds the database and is able to mutate the data when necessary, this front end
serves as a means to communicate with the backend in a safe manner without direct
access to the database making it a pretty safe to operate.
